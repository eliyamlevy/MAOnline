# MAOnline
An online python-based version of a card game called MAO

This project is currently under development.

I plan to convert the main game logic into a webserver so it can be played online.
As of the most recent push the game is playable in the terminal with some basic
ascii graphics. I am currently working on creating a fluid and generic ruleset 
class which will allow for the dynamic addition of rules into the gameplay, which
is a major part of how MAO is played.

The reason I started this project was to connect my close friends and I that were 
seperated by the current quarentining practice by creating our favorite card game
in an online format. I plan on using the core of this project to write up a 
generic card game framework for future projects or anyone else who chooses to use
it.
